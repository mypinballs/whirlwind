class Trough(procgame.game.Mode):
	"""Manages trough by providing the following functionality:

		- Keeps track of the number of balls in play
		- Keeps track of the number of balls in the trough
		- Launches one or more balls on request and calls a launch_callback when complete, if one exists.
		- Auto-launches balls while ball save is active (if linked to a ball save object
		- Identifies when balls drain and calls a registered drain_callback, if one exists.
		- Maintains a count of balls locked in playfield lock features (if externally incremented) and adjusts the count of number of balls in play appropriately.  This will help the drain_callback distinguish between a ball ending or simply a multiball ball draining.

	Parameters:

		'game': Parent game object.
		'position_switchnames': List of switchnames for each ball position in the trough.
		'eject_switchname': Name of switch in the ball position the feeds the shooter lane.
		'eject_coilname': Name of coil used to put a ball into the shooter lane.
		'early_save_switchnames': List of switches that will initiate a ball save before the draining ball reaches the trough (ie. Outlanes).
		'shooter_lane_switchname': Name of the switch in the shooter lane.  This is checked before a new ball is ejected.
		'drain_callback': Optional - Name of method to be called when a ball drains (and isn't saved).
